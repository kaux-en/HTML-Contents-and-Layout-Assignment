            <p>This article discusses how to pamper, protect and play with your furry friends.</p>

            <h2>A Beneficial Schedule</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Your Puppy's Feeding Schedule</h3>
                <p>Unlike mature dogs that eat once or twice a day, most puppies need to eat puppy food three times a day. Make it easier to remember by planning his mealtimes around your own breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Wash out his water bowl and make sure it's always filled with clean water, too.</p>

                <h3>Your Puppy's Potty Breaks</h3>
                <p>Keep to a regular routine of taking your puppy outside at least every two-to-four hours and after every change of activity. This is especially important during house training and will keep accidents to a minimum</p>

                <h3>Playtime</h3>
                <p>Your puppy needs exercise and interaction with you. A word of caution: sustained, strenuous exercise (long runs, jumping) is not good for puppies, but playing, mental stimulation, and running around in the yard are good. Some experts recommend waiting until a dog is about one year old before starting with serious exercise and this can vary by breed.</p>

                <h2>A Sample Schedule</h2>

                    <p><strong>First Thing in the Morning:</strong> Take the puppy out to relieve himself. Make time to play and interact with him after he's taken care of business.</p>
                    <p><strong>Breakfast Time:</strong> Feed the puppy. Leave the food down for no longer than 15 minutes. After that, pick up the bowl and give no more food until the next meal (except for small treats used for training). Wash the water bowl and provide clean water.</p>
                    <p><strong>After Puppy's Breakfast to Noon:</strong> Puppies usually need to relieve themselves again, within a few minutes of eating, so give another potty opportunity. The rest of the morning might be devoted to nap time, ideally in a dog crate or pen. A repeat of the early morning routine - as soon as he wakes up, a trip outside.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dinner to Bedtime:</strong> If you arrange his mealtimes around yours, it will become natural to feed him either while you're preparing dinner or while the household is eating. In the evening, another potty break! A set bedtime makes his adjustment and house training easier for everyone.</p>
